  abstract = {The aggregate motion of a flock of birds, a herd of
                 land animals, or a school of fish is a beautiful and
                 familiar part of the natural world. But this type of
                 complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation.
                 This paper explores an approach based on simulation as
                 an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird
                 individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of
                 a particle system, with the simulated birds being the
                 particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock
                 is created by a distributed behavioral model much like
                 that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their
                 own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an
                 independent actor that navigates according to its local
                 perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of
                 simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of
                 behaviours programmed into it by the {"}animator.{"}
                 The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the
                 result of the dense interaction of the relatively
                 simple behaviours of the individual simulated birds.},

abstract = {Swarm-based algorithms emerged as a powerful family of optimization techniques, inspired by the collective behavior of social animals. In particle swarm optimization (PSO) the set of candidate solutions to the optimization problem is defined as a swarm of particles which may flow through the parameter space defining trajectories which are driven by their own and neighbors' best performances. In the present paper, the potential of particle swarm optimization for solving various kinds of optimization problems in chemometrics is shown through an extensive description of the algorithm (highlighting the importance of the proper choice of its metaparameters) and by means of selected worked examples in the fields of signal warping, estimation robust PCA solutions and variable selection.}

The first step is to approximate each neighborhood of both frames by quadratic polynomials, which can be done efficiently using the polynomial expansion transform. From observing how an exact polynomial transforms under translation a method to estimate displacement fields from the polynomial expansion coefficients is derived and after a series of refinements leads to a robust algorithm. Evaluation on the Yosemite sequence shows good results.",

    abstract = { Neutrophils play a major role in the early immune response and are recruited in large numbers into inflamed and infected tissues. By secreting chemoattractants that bind G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) on neighboring cells, neutrophils coordinate their behavior as a swarm. Less clear is how this auto-amplifying swarming activity is ultimately turned off. Kienle et al. show that desensitization of these GPCRs by the same chemoattractants by GPCR-kinase 2 (GRK2) is one way in which these swarms are shut down (see the Perspective by Rocha-Gregg and Huttenlocher). Unexpectedly, mice with GRK2-deficient neutrophils showed impaired rather than enhanced bacterial clearance. The heightened scanning ability of GRK2-deficient neutrophils may come at the cost of suboptimal phagocytosis and containment of bacteria. Science, abe7729, this issue p. eabe7729; see also abj3065, p. 1262 Neutrophils have evolved an intrinsic mechanism to limit swarming and avoid uncontrolled aggregation during inflammation. Neutrophils communicate with each other to form swarms in infected organs. Coordination of this population response is critical for the elimination of bacteria and fungi. Using transgenic mice, we found that neutrophils have evolved an intrinsic mechanism to self-limit swarming and avoid uncontrolled aggregation during inflammation. G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization acts as a negative feedback control to stop migration of neutrophils when they sense high concentrations of self-secreted attractants that initially amplify swarming. Interference with this process allows neutrophils to scan larger tissue areas for microbes. Unexpectedly, this does not benefit bacterial clearance as containment of proliferating bacteria by neutrophil clusters becomes impeded. Our data reveal how autosignaling stops self-organized swarming behavior and how the finely tuned balance of neutrophil chemotaxis and arrest counteracts bacterial escape. }
